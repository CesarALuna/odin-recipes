    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Korean fried chicken was described by Julia Moskin of The New York Times 
        as a "thin, crackly and almost transparent crust".The chicken is usually 
        seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. 
        Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized 
        chickens; these younger chickens result in more tender meat. After frying, 
        the chicken is usually hand-painted with sauce using a brush in order to 
        evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer. 
        Pickled radishes and beer (or carbonated drink) are often served with 
        Korean fried chicken.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Stir chicken, onion, garlic, fine salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black 
                pepper together in a bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the 
                bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F 
                (171 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 
                and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Gradually 
                whisk ice water into flour in until mixture resembles a smooth 
                pancake batter. Transfer chicken to batter and stir to coat 
                chicken completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Working in batches, cook chicken in preheated oil for 4 
                minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to a cooling rack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase oil temperature in the deep-fryer or large saucepan 
                to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Working in batches, cook chicken again in hot oil until golden 
                brown and crispy on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a 
                wire rack to drain.
